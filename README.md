# 🚗 DeepDrive : Autonomous Driving 

![alt text](https://github.com/KALYAN1045/Autonomous-Driving-Udacity/blob/main/self-driving.gif?raw=true)

Implemented a robust behavioral cloning model for autonomous vehicle navigation in the Udacity Simulator, leveraging deep learning techniques. The goal is to enable the vehicle to effectively mimic human driving behavior through the acquisition and application of behavioral data, ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation within the simulated environment.

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset I used for training for the Car / You can create your own dataset by running the car in manual mode in simulator:  

```
git clone https://github.com/rslim087a/track
```

## 📝 Steps to run this project:

### STEP 1️⃣: 
Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KALYAN1045/Autonomous-Driving-Udacity
```

### STEP 2️⃣: 
Create an virual environment in conda & activate it ! 🚀

```bash
conda create -n sdcar python=3.7 -y
```

### STEP 3️⃣: 

Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### STEP 4️⃣: 
Now to start the drive run the following command

```bash
python drive.py
```

Now open your simulator in Autonomous mode & run!!🙂
